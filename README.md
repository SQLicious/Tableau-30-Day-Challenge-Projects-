# Tableau-30-Day-Challenge-Projects-
Browse through my "Tableau 30 Day Challenge Projects" repository, a compilation of Tableau work undertaken during the Tableauvember challenge in November 2023. This collection showcases my progress and learning journey as I prepared for the Tableau Desktop Specialist exam throughout the month of November with Albert Bellamy and other Challenge participants.

Feel free to explore and gain insights into various Tableau topics applied in each Tableau project of progressive complexity created during this intensive training period.
